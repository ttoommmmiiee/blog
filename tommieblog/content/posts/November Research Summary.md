In 1997, artist and music producer Terre Thaemlitz released her album *Die Roboter* under the moniker Rubato. The album comprises piano interpretations of classic Kraftwerk titles. On first listen, the piano rendition sounds like a live performance by a talented and expressive pianist, playing a real piano with rich acoustic tones. The only sonic hint of manipulation is the noise that washes over the piano playing.

Rubato, the name under which Terre 'performs' these works, comes from the phrase 'tempo rubato', literally translated as 'stolen time' in Italian, but specifically referencing the musical instruction allowing the performer to play expressively by speeding up and slowing down the music's tempo. Whilst Kraftwerk's musical output was defined by its interest in the robotic, mechanical performance of music, Terre's interpretations turn this on its head - adding a kitschy romantic and humanistic expression to the music. However there's another level of obfuscation at play, as these works are not played by a talented and expressive pianist, but instead were programmed meticulously and painstakingly by Terre using the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) communications protocol.  

The human interfacing with the computer, to perform 'humanness', through renditions of music that explicitly explored the human performing the machine (Kraftwerk). 

Computer music has often been assumed to be lacking humanity. Or that humanness needed to be added to computer music through different means to make it more enjoyable or consumable to a general audience. Machine Learning offers us new methods for algorithmically adding 'humanness' to computer-generated music. The real playing character of musicians can be used as data to add variation and expression to generative music. Voice can be synthesised with new levels of complexity and naturalism. 

**I am interested in exploring our assumptions about 'humanness' in music and creativity by considering the following instincts and questions:**

- 'Humanness' is not a universal, fixed quality that can be added to music. If we take being as a process of becoming, then fixing human performance in a dataset, fixes our idea of being, captures it in a static state. 

- Which humans are represented in the data that feed Machine Learning? Music and culture have rich, communal genealogies so where do these datasets fit into that?  

- What musical gestures are attributed to humanness and why? What are the cultural assumptions behind attributing humanness to styles such as Funk, Jazz and Swing? There is a history behind ascribing authenticity to black cultural styles despite or perhaps because black people have often been excluded from the category of human. 

- How does human creativity relate to our ideas of nature, the ecological and the posthuman? 

- Despite the shortcomings of the representation of the human via algorithms is there an opportunity there, in that misrepresentation, to escape representation, to go on strike from representation?  How not to be heard?
