Recently I watched a talk by Eleni Ikoniadou in which she presented her recent work *Future Chrous*. https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/QTHPSU-1

She discussed how in western thinking, speech is often taken as a marker of human inteligence. For Aristottle via Heidegger - man is a political speaking animal, a being who has a language which addresses and discusses its world. For the Greeks, voice without speech was considered irrational and dangerous associated with female, animal, disabled and non-human entities 

In this context, Eleni outline the lament, a passionate expression of grief or sorrow, as a deeply irrational vocality. 

> "Mostly the terror of the lament lies in its extemporaneous, untamed, inhuman dimension; that which reveals it as a sonorous force of unspecified destiny and unknown origin, separate from the body that hosts it." https://www.urbanomic.com/chapter/audint-the-lament/

This discussion on lament made me think immediately about this track by Dj Rashad and Freshmoon called "Everybody" 

{{< youtube yGlMaZ3WEN4 >}}

It samples and autotunes a viral video of a man expressing a deep sorrow through a loud cry.

Such a vocal expression of grief in public is startling and it is probably unsurprising that it became a viral video since the internet loves to laugh at vulnerability on camera. It is perhaps important to mention that the man in the viral video is black and so there is a larger context here between the alignment of irrational vocalisations with the non-human and the historical and continuing denial of marginalised and racialised people to the category of the "human". 

What I find interesting is that its hard to tell if the DJ Rashard and Freshmoon track is continuing the joke. In many ways the track belongs to the same genre as other 'autotune' tracks that sample the venacular speech in viral videos.

However, could it also be read differently as if the footwork producers are reclaiming the emotional core of the cry. Giving it back its power to convey intense and uncontrollable emotion. 

In Alexander Weheliye's paper 'Feenin'  he talks about how the vocoder/autotune effect is used in R&B to technological augment and entangle human desire. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/31935](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/31935)

> "This _feenin_ dissolves the parameters of the coherent subject in such radical ways that human—all too human—desire can be represented only in the guise of the machinic, and the human is thus inextricably intertwined with various informational technologies." 

So in this entangled state the status of the cry and Rashad et al's reworking might not clear cut. It might be somewhere inbetween. Both humanising and dehumanising where the viralirty of the cry gives it a power for a different kind of escape. 

This made me think about Hito Steyerl's 2012 essay "The Spam of the Earth: Withdrawal from Representation" https://www.e-flux.com/journal/32/68260/the-spam-of-the-earth-withdrawal-from-representation/

In this essay Hito, upends our assuptions about image spam - those found in unread junk emails promoting ways to get thin, or strong, or horny, rich. For Hito, there is a movement towards not wanting to be seen - a suspision about the widespread surveilance of modern life. To be seen is also paradocically to be made invisible - "...the zone of corporate representation is largely one of exception, which seems dangerous to enter: you may be derided, tested, stressed, or even starved or killed. Rather than representing people it exemplifies the vanishing of the people: it’s gradual disappearance."

This leads Hito to suggest:

> Lets boldly assume that image spam is a negative image of its constituency because people are _also_ actively walking away from this kind of representation, leaving behind only enhanced crash-test dummies. Thus image spam becomes an involuntary record of a subtle strike, a walkout of the people from photographic and moving-image representation. It is a document of an almost imperceptible exodus from a field of power relations that are too extreme to be survived without major reduction and downsizing. Rather than a document of domination, image spam is the people’s monument of resistance to being represented _like this_. They are leaving the _given_ frame of representation.

The crying video is not spam, it doesn't present perfection, rather it presents venerability and its success as a viral video betrays a voyeristic inclination to read the cry as dehumanising and worthy of ridicule. But maybe it still operates similar to Hito's image spam. It becomes a stand in, allowing us to be vunerable though withdrawal from representation, and through Rashad and Freshmoon's reworking it might also allow withdrawal from representation as human.

Thanks for reading, this is a blog post tying a few threads together and is not a completed essay so applogies for errors and gaps. It's also funny that most of the references in this text are from around 2012 - 2013. I guess I have some unresolved thoughts from the time that I finished my undergraduate degree!
